[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p>Listen to the following passage about Deborah Hardy's packing rules.</p><p>Deborah Hardy has turned traveling light into an art form. She and her husband Ken have explored the world extensively since retiring, only ever carrying hand luggage. Hardy says they do it because it simplifies everything. It makes no difference whether they are visiting cold climates or rainforests, even though some of their trips last for up to three months. She also mentions that since they don't check bags, they are free to alter their travel plans and will never lose their luggage. Carry-on bags have strict size and weight limits. Therefore, packing everything needed for three months into carry-on bags means every item has to be carefully selected. Everything must match. In addition, clothing must be lightweight and quick drying. Because it will get washed frequently. Deborah says she has to love every piece of clothing because it will get worn repeatedly. This \"less is more\" approach to traveling represents the thought of a growing number of people as they reject consumerism to find meaning through simplifying their lives.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 According to Deborah, what are the two rules she follows when selecting clothes for a trip?</br>ets_th2 Do you want to travel light like Deboran and Ken?
