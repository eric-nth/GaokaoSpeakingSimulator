[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p>What is Virtual Reality?</p><p>The definition of \"virtual\" is near and \"reality\" is what we experience as human beings. So the term \"virtual reality\" basically means \"near-reality\". This could, of course, mean anything but it usually refers to a specific type of reality imitation.</p><p>We know the world through our senses and perception systems. In school we all learned that we have five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight and hearing. These are, however, only our most obvious sense organs. The truth is that humans have many more senses than this, such as a sense of balance, for example. These other sensory inputs, plus some special processing of sensory information by our brains ensures that we have a rich flow of information from the environment to our minds.</p><p>Our entire experience of reality is simply a combination of sensory information and our brains' sense-making mechanisms for that information. It is natural then, that if you can present your senses with made-up information, your perception of reality would also change in response to it. You would be presented with a version of reality that isn't really there, but from your perspective, it would be perceived as real. This is something we would refer to as virtual reality.</p><p>So, in summary, virtual reality is the creation of a virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we experience it as if we were really there.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 According to the passage, what does \"virtual reality\" refer to?</br>ets_th2 In which field can \"virtual reality\" be well applied and why?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask1","code_value":"ets_th1 According to the passage, what does \"virtual reality\" refer to?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask2","code_value":"ets_th2 In which field can \"virtual reality\" be well applied and why?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
