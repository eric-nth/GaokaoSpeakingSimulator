So the term \"virtual reality\" basically means \"near-reality\". This could, of course, mean anything but it usually refers to a specific type of reality imitation.<\/p><p>We know the world through our senses and perception systems. In school we all learned that we have five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight and hearing. These are, however, only our most obvious sense organs. The truth is that humans have many more senses than this, such as a sense of balance, for example. These other sensory inputs, plus some special processing of sensory information by our brains ensures that we have a rich flow of information from the environment to our minds.<\/p><p>Our entire experience of reality is simply a combination of sensory information and our brains' sense-making mechanisms for that information. It is natural then, that if you can present your senses with made-up information, your perception of reality would also change in response to it. You would be presented with a version of reality that isn't really there, but from your perspective, it would be perceived as real. This is something we would refer to as virtual reality.<\/p><p>So, in summary, virtual reality is the creation of a virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we experience it as if we were really there.<\/p>","stid":"526730","audio":"content.mp3"}}
