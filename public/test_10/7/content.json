Anyone who buys a Northwest e-ticket through the airline's computer service by June 16 will get an award. Next time you fly, you can buy another ticket for a friend for $99, going anywhere in the US or Canada through Dec. 12, 2016 along with the lowest ticket prices.<\/p><p>Some airlines offer frequent passenger extra miles for the electronic ticket. And there is rising punishment for paper lovers. Last week, America, Northwest, United, and US Airways have raised the cost for lost-ticket replacement to $70 from either $60 or $50.
