[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p>My biggest challenge as a college student is time management. In high school, my homework could usually be completed in class. After a long week of school, I always found time to have fun. I could go to every football and basketball game and every party, even if it meant stealing out of the house. In high school, homework was not as important as it is in college. </p><p>Even so, there are so many parties in college. My first year in college was all about parties, and I struggled with my assignments. The importance of managing my time didn't hit me until the end of my fall semester as a second year student. I thought my grades would not be high enough to keep my academic scholarship. I remember crying in the office of one of my professors. I also recall having to do extra assignments in some of my other classes.</p><p>When I found out I could lose my scholarship, I thought I would die. I could not sleep or eat until I found out my grades. However, I didn't fail any of my classes. I also kept my scholarship. From then on, I began using all my free time to study. At first I had to force myself to study on weekends. Now I know parties can wait, because graduating is more important.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 How did the author realize the importance of managing his time?</br>ets_th2 In your opinion, how to improve one's time management?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask1","code_value":"ets_th1 How did the author realize the importance of managing his time?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask2","code_value":"ets_th2 In your opinion, how to improve one's time management?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
