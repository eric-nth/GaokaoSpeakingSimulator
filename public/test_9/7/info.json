[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p>Listen to the following passage about Halloween.</p><p>Ghosts are more than Halloween decorations or clothing for many Americans who confess they believe in the supernatural and returning from the grave. 37 percent of 2,100 adults questioned in a survey say they think ghosts are real, and 23 percent believe they have been visited by a late relative or friend. Even the 22 percent who say they have not had any ghostly experiences themselves know someone who has.</p><p>\"More than a third of Americans have this belief that ghosts do exist,\" said a spokesman for the survey, adding that the findings were surprising. Nearly half of those questioned said if they could be a ghost, they would choose to come back themselves. But belief in the supernatural is not required to enjoy Halloween. 87 percent of parents said their children would be dressing up for the holiday and 71 percent would be trick-or-treating. But 41 percent of adults said they were not celebrating Halloween, including 12 percent who mentioned religious reasons.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 How many people are surveyed and how many of them believe that ghosts do exist?</br>ets_th2 What's your favourite festival and how do you celebrate it?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask1","code_value":"ets_th1 How many people are surveyed and how many of them believe that ghosts do exist?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask2","code_value":"ets_th2 What's your favourite festival and how do you celebrate it?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
