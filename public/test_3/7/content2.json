It also pointed out that people are tending to sleep less and average sleep quality is declining.<\/p><p>The study surveyed more than 6,000 people aged between 18 and 71. More than 60 percent of respondents had less than eight hours of sleep a day, with new mothers, college students and office workers having more trouble sleeping. Surfing the internet, long work or study hours, and sleep disorders such as sleeplessness are major factors affecting sleep hours, according to the report.<\/p><p>The Chinese Sleep Research Society also released a white paper last week that analyzed the sleep conditions of different groups in China. It said that more than 60 percent of teenagers use smartphones, play games and watch TV series when they should be sleeping.<\/p><p>The white paper also looked at sleep patterns among eight income groups. Those with no income slept best, followed by those on high-middle annual incomes of 300,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.<\/p>","stid":"526778","audio":"content.mp3"}}
