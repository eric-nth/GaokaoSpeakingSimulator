When we think of holidays, we think of traveling, beaches, fun and adventures. But the reality is, we spend most of our holidays on our personal digital products. Smartphones have taken the world by storm, influencing the manner we interact with each other. Does this sound like you? If so, it sounds like you need a digital detox. One of the best things about a digital detox is the fact that anyone can do it. Whether you are a businessman or a student, everyone needs some time away from technology. Having a tech-free holiday is becoming increasingly popular especially among families. The reason is obvious. It enables them to spend quality time together without being distracted by social media. While it may seem that sending a quick text message or uploading a photo to WeChat doesn't take so much time, these things eventually add up without us even knowing it. Whether to give yourself a digital detox is a difficult decision to make. However, it may be just the thing you need to cleanse your mind, body and soul. To help you along, it is probably a good idea to choose a remote area, somewhere close to nature, where you can truly immerse yourself.<\/p>","stid":"526742","audio":"content.mp3"}}
