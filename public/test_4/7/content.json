First and foremost, arrive 15 minutes early prior to your interview. An interview is even more stressful than normal if you're rushing to get there on time. Second, send a positive message through your body language. Shake hands firmly, but only if a hand is offered to you first. Always maintain eye contact and listen carefully. If you do not understand a question, ask the interviewer to either repeat or clarify the question for you. Give honest, direct answers. However, be sure that your responses are focused on the questions and highlight the skills related to the job. Keep in mind that your responses are your sales pitch. You're selling the interviewer on yourself as the best candidate for a second interview and for the job, so be sure you focus on your relevancy. Last but not least, towards the end of the interview let the hiring manager know that you think the job is an excellent fit and that you are very interested in the job. It's appropriate to ask what the next step in the hiring process will be and when you might expect to hear.<\/p>","stid":"526766","audio":"content.mp3"}}
