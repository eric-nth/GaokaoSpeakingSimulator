Here are some tips that may help. One, take comfortable, easy-to-clean clothes. Don't take too much. For a week, you should take two to three shirts and pairs of trousers, one to two pairs of shoes, a jacket or a jumper, a swimsuit and lots of underwear. Two, don't forget the necessities. Take toothpaste, sunscreen and a small first aid kit. Three, put your shoes in plastic bags inside your suitcase, so they don't dirty your clothes. Four, keep your passport with you at all times. Five, do not carry any sharp objects, such as penknives, nail clippers or scissors in your hand luggage. Put them in your suitcase. Six, put any breakable items like cameras in your hand luggage.<\/p>","stid":"526802","audio":"content.mp3"}}
